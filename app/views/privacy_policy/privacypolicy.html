    a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates
    websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a
    conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
    those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at:
    https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-
    protection-act-caloppa-3/<br><br>

    specified above on the home page of our website;<br>

    We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a
    Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in
    your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.
    You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your
    web browser.<br>
    12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)<br>

    provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the
    previous 12 months.<br>
    (b) To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the
    personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records
    and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be
    accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your
    personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your
    personal information to operate.<br>

    for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal
    information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary

    such transfers. If you are a California resident, to opt-out of the sale of your personal
