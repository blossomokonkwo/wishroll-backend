    #The message notification worker encapsulates all of the functionality that is required to push a notification to
    #a user prompting them to check out an unread message. The logic that is needed to perform such an operation is as follows.
    #First we need to distinguish between an unread and read message. 
    #1. A message or a collection of messages are deemed as read when a user appears in the chat room of that message or messages.
    #2. The sum of a users unread messages can be calculated by adding the all the messages sent in a chat room that the user belongs to that he/she has not read - not entered the chat room since-.
    #ex) If user A enters a chat room, all the unread messages in that chat room are then marked as read. If the same user leaves the same chat room - by clicking out of the chat room or swiping out - any new messages in that chat room will be marked as unread.
    #3. Users should only recieve remote push notifications when they are outside of the app. Users should recieve in app notifications when they're in app but not in the chat room from whenst the notification is coming from.
    #4. Users should not recieve any notification when they're currently in the chat room that the message was sent from.
    #5. The Message controller class handles all of the logic that is required to send the remote push notifications to the need users - the users in the chat room except for the message sender.
    #6. The notifications should display the sender of the message, the content of the message - if a media item the url - and a sound that allows the app to uniquely recognize the app.
